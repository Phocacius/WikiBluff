  "introtext": "<p>WikiBluff is a game in which knowledge from Wikipedia is faked. Each player (<i>Faker</i>) picks a word from Wikipedia and reads through the corresponding article. Then one word is randomly chosen from all submitted words. Everyone now tries to convince the <i>Guesser</i> that they read the article about the drawn word. Any story can be made up in the process. After presenting and a Q&A round a vote is taken by the Guessers to see who told the truth. </p> <p>The inspiration came from the YouTube channel of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRUULstZRWS1lDvJBzHnkXA\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Scott</a>, a sample video in which the rules are explained again is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAOs9B9UH8\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>",
